<p >The Indian Red Cross Society will provide sustained and effective humanitarian service, committed to building resilient communities. It will be run by well-trained and dedicated staff and volunteers imbued with integrity, equipped with necessary logistics, and utilizing information technology to its maximum potential. We will continue to expand our volunteer network in every part of the country to ensure the swift delivery of our services.</P>
<P>Currently, the Indian Red Cross Society provides six major services: Blood Services, Disaster Management Services, Safety Services, Health Services, Social Services, Red Cross Youth, and Volunteer Services. All of these services embody the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, including humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality. These values serve as a guiding force and a source of inspiration for all Red Cross staff and volunteers. Being a Red Crosser is more than just a philosophy; it is a way of life.</P>
